autotools2
==========

This software is in its cradle, it's not useable yet, don't even try to use this
in production :)

Auto tools bundle that is more flexible and more lightweight

This bundle supposed to be compatible with the original autotools,
it's mostly written in C++ and bash, the produced configure script is meant
to be more flexible and more readable.

This bundle is meant to support most modern features, including modern languages
like java and C#


Why it exist
============

Because original autotools are a bit complex to use and produces over bloated shell script,
which even if it's very cross-UNIX compatible, it consist of constructions that some
users might find ancient, and that we today, can do more easily.

Differences
===========

* Written in C++ and hosted here on github, so that anyone can easily contribute
* Using LGPL so that it's suitable for commercial solutions as well


Note: This source code was written from scratch by me, it doesn't use any original
      code from GNU auto tools, and therefore is not bound by its license.
